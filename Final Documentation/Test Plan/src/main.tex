\section{Overview}
The purpose of this document is to provide a plan for testing our FollowThrough application. The following outline gives a description of what is covered in this document. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item A proof of concept test is detailed in section 2. 
    \item System testing is described in section 3. 
    \item Software requirements specification testing is described in section 4. 
    \item A time line for the Test Plan is presented in section 5. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Testing}
Before being able to do any other testing, there needs to be a proof of concept test. This test will be in place to ensure the project at hand is feasible in the first place.

\subsection{Significant Risks}
To have this project be successful we would first need to overcome a small number of major risks. Those risks are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The software needs to be able to successfully track the ball no matter where it goes. This is the basis of the entire system and if it doesn't work the project is no longer feasible.
    \item The next most important risk to overcome would be making sure that the hardware is well protected in its environment. This could either be inclement weather or physical objects making contact with the gear.
    \item Lastly, the software needs to be able to successfully upload/update any information over a server. If the server is to crash or the connection becomes disconnected the software must retain the information in a different way.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\subsection{Demonstration Plan}
The plan for the demonstration is to present a video of one of the developers playing basketball and have the software track the ball. The cases for this demonstration will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Starting a few feet away from the net, being perpendicular to it. 
    \item Make a few shots, some are intentionally missed and some are intentionally made.
\end{itemize}


This demonstration is done this way to show that the ball can be tracked properly, even though it will be losing sight of the ball for a fraction of a second as it passes through the hoop or off screen.

\section{System Testing}
The system testing will be composed of three major sections. There will be the OpenCV/Python program testing that ensures the program processes the video correctly. There will the hardware testing which will ensure the Camera and Rasberry Pi is functioning correctly. Finally there will be website testing. Test cases for each of these sections will be detailed below.

\section{Requirements Testing}
After the project is implemented and tested, the functional and non-functional requirements are to be examined. The functional requirements in this case will all be tested during the general system testing whereas the non-functional requirements will have to be tested separately.

\subsection{Functional Requirements Testing}
All of the functional requirements are tested in the System Testing section. The trace between the tests and the requirements are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1. Encrypt Data:} This will be tested by entering the password and examining what was actually stored.
    \item \textbf{2. Decrypt Data:} This will be tested by seeing if passwords which are known to be correct are accepted.
    \item \textbf{3. Store Results:} This will simply be tested by ensuring all data recorded will be stored on the cloud.
    \item \textbf{4. Authenticate User:} Similarly to encrypt and decrypt data this will simply be tested by trying to log in with a user name and password combination which is known to be working.
    \item \textbf{5. Upload Data:} This one will be easily tested together with Storing Results.
    \item \textbf{6. Record Data:} This one will be tested together with Upload Data and Storing Results.
    \item \textbf{7. Give Feedback:} Requirement number seven will be tested on the court and on the computer. The tests will consists of case by case testing (i.e. If you stand 3 feet away from the net, we expect the entry angle should be X, but it's actually Y).
    \item \textbf{8. Access Data:} Requirement number eight will be tested by logging in to the web site and checking to see if the data uploaded reflects the data gathered earlier in the testing.
    \item \textbf{9. Retrieve Data:} This requirements will be easily tested as it is a part of the Access Data requirement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Error Testing}
Error testing will occur throughout the system testing. In any case where the system is being tested, error testing will happen immediately afterwards to ensure nothing is over-looked.

\subsection{The Hardware}
Tests will be in place to ensure that the disconnection of any piece of hardware does not result in a total loss. This will be done by intentionally disconnecting pieces of equipment to see how the application will respond and what needs to be fixed. Those tests will be as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the camera on the computer shuts off, the application is to alert the user. This will be tested by purposely disconnecting the camera.
    \item If the sensor on the net becomes disconnected, the application is once again meant to alert the user. This will again be done by purposely disconnecting it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Web Interface}
Tests on the web interface will be largely done case-by-case (meaning that we will create scenarios and see how the interface reacts in the said scenarios). This will likely consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will test what happens when somebody who has not yet registered tries to sign in by entering a user name and password combination which does not already exist.
    \item We will test what happens when the user has already registered but they are trying to register again with the same details. This will be done by trying to register with information which is already in the server.
    \item What happens when the user accidentally resets their password will also be tested, by doing just that.
    \item Lastly, a test will be in place to see what happens when the user enters their information incorrectly. This will also be done just by doing the action.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Application}
The tests made in this section will be focused on the errors the user can make while using the application on the court. Many of these tests will be scenario tests like most of the testing done previously. The aforementioned tests are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User entering the wrong log in information will be tested by doing just that.
    \item The user no angling the camera properly will be tested by performing the action, then the results will be recorded to see how it can be fixed.
    \item The user playing with more than one ball will also be tested by playing with more than one ball.
    \item Testing will be done to see how much the user shaking the recording device could affect the results.
    \item Every other algorithm related test will be performed in the form of unit testing. This will consist of any possible edge cases that exist.
\end{itemize}
